des of pathogenicity, we have identified numerous protein domains and multi-gene families that are expanded in pathogens of cereal or trees, when compared to the other Dothideomycetes. Their role is generally unknown, the power of comparative genomics is huge and will become increasingly important as more genomes are sequenced. For fungi in general and  Dothideomycetes in particular the field is ascending rapidly. Several other  Dothideomycetes have been sequenced or are in progress and will provide greater representation of the extensive pathogenic and ecological diversity in this largest class of fungi. Completion of the 1000 Fungal Genomes project ( http://jgi.doe.gov/fungi) at the US DOE Joint Genome Institute plus numerous genomes sequenced through other initiatives provide a huge wealth of virtually untapped resources for future progress in understanding fungal biology and evolution. There are large variations in genome size between the  Dothideomycetes, but the observation that in one case in  L. maculans all the genes in one conserved block of genes are up-regulated during plant infection suggests that co-regulation may be an important factor in pathogenesis. We have shown that genes for effector proteins, occur often in close proximity to transposable elements (TEs) in several  Dothideomycetes. TEs are frequently a target of Repeat Induced Point (RIP) mutations

"ward producing specialized metabolites in specific organs such as PGTs for plants ecological benefit.""","Terpenes are organic compounds and play important roles in plant growth and development as well as in mediating interactions of plants with the environment. Terpene synthases (TPSs) are the key enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of terpenes. Although some species were employed for the genome-wide identification and characterization of the TPS family, limited information is available regarding the evolution, expansion, and retention mechanisms occurring in this gene family. We performed a genome-wide identification of the TPS family members in 50 sequenced genomes. Additionally, we also characterized the TPS family from aromatic spearmint and basil plants using RNA-Seq data. No TPSs were identified in algae genomes but the remaining plant species encoded various numbers of the family members ranging from 2 to 79 full-length TPSs. Some species showed lineage-specific expansion of certain subfamilies, which might have contributed toward species or ecotype divergence or environmental adaptation. A large-scale family expansion was observed mainly in dicot and monocot plants, which was accompanied by frequent domain loss. Both tandem and segmental duplication significantly contributed toward family expansion and expression divergence and played important roles in the survival of these expanded genes. Our data provide new insight into the TPS family expansion and evolution and suggest that TPSs might have originated from isoprenyl diphosphate synthase genes.","Evolution', 'Terpene synthase',

from the chemical phenotype of a corresponding plant mutant, the genetic resources for such an approach are available only for a very few model systems such as Arabidopsis  25', ' Instead, in most systems, the functional annotation of each TPS requires expression and enzyme characterization of recombinant protein', ' Recombinant spruce TPSs were expressed in  E', ' Since two recent reports described the occurrence and conversion of  cis-prenyl diphosphate substrates in tomato  26- 28, we also assessed if spruce is likely to produce these additional TPS substrates', ' Functional

metabolism and those that enhance TPS gene duplication and functional diversification in specialized metabolism in a conifer genome are not known but are worthy of future investigation', ' The high functional plasticity of the TPS-d family and the great diversity of terpenoids produced may impart fitness advantages against a multitude of pests and pathogens', ' We speculate that the TPS-d genes

TPS-d2 clade are the longifolene synthases; and in the TPS-d3 clade are the levopimaradiene/abietadiene synthases and isopimaradiene synthases', ' In the TPS-d3 group of conifer diterpene synthases, the basal function of a multi-product levopimaradiene/abietadiene synthase had apparently evolved prior to conifer speciation, as this function exists in a group of closely related genes from the genera  Abies,  Pinus and  Picea', ' Overall, the large diversity of gene functions among the many closely related genes of the conifer TPS-d1 group illustrates the many events of gene duplications

(genotype FB3-425; PsTPS-Car1), and one in hybrid white spruce (PgÌÑeTPS-Car1) (Tables  2 and  3, Figure  2)', ' These two (+)-3-carene synthases shared approximately 99% amino acid identity to each other, and were likely the orthologues of the (+)-3-carene synthases PsTPS-car1(R) and PsTPS-car1(S) recently described (Figure  1)', ' Despite the similarity of product profiles, the Sitka spruce and hybrid white spruce (+)-3-carene synthase both shared only 84% percent amino acid sequence identity with the Norway spruce TPS', ' Functional characterization of diterpene synthases The sequences of PsTPS-LAS and PaTPS-LAS differed by only 12 amino acids, and PsTPS-Iso and PaTPS-Iso differed by only 35 amino acids', ' In a detailed investigation of the PaTPS-LAS and PaTPS-Iso enzymes, using reciprocal site-directed mutagenesis and domain-swapping, we have recently shown that four amino acid residues determine the different product profiles of these Norway spruce diterpene synthases  24', ' These product-determining residues are identical between the levopimaradiene/abietadiene synthases (PsTPS-LAS and PaTPS-LAS) in Sitka and Norway spruce, consistent with their similar product profiles', ' However, only three of these residues are identical between the isopimaradiene synthases (PsTPS-Iso and PaTPS-Iso) in Sitka and Norway spruce; the fourth residue (V732) is the same as that found in the Norway spruce levopimaradiene/abietadiene synthase', ' In our previous study  24, the corresponding reciprocal L725V mutation obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of PaTPS-Iso resulted in the formation of sandaracopimaradiene as a minor product', ' This product profile change is consistent with the new observation that the isopimaradiene synthase from Sitka spruce (PsTPS-Iso) naturally produced sandaracopimaradiene as a minor compound (Table  2, Figure  4)', ' Overall, these results highlight how mutations produced in the laboratory that determine product profile differences also exist in nature and do result in the evolution of altered TPS product profiles between species or genotypes', ' Two paralogous diterpene synthases, PsTPS-LAS and PsTPS-Iso, were characterized in Sitka spruce (Tables  2 and  3, Figure  4)', ' These TPSs shared 90% identity and they are the orthologues of levopimaradiene/abietadiene synthase (PaTPS-LAS) and isopimaradiene synthase (PaTPS-Iso) from Norway spruce  14 (Figure  1)', ' They belong to the TPS-d3 clade of the gymnosperm TPS-d family', ' PsTPS-LAS produced a similar multi-product profile as its ortholog in Norway spruce, composed of abietadiene (49%), levopimaradiene (24%), neoabietadiene (23%), and palustradiene (4%)', ' In contrast to the single-product isopimaradiene synthase from Norway spruce  14, Sitka spruce PsTPS-Iso produced minor amounts of sandaracopimaradiene (2%) in addition to isopimaradiene (98%) (Table  2, Figure  4)', ' PsTPS-Iso is the first gymnosperm TPS identified to naturally produce sandaracopimaradiene, albeit in minor amounts', ' PsTPS-LAS and PsTPS-Iso play an important role in the overall diterpene resin acid defence systems of Sitka spruce', ' Accumulation of all of these diterpene resin acids was induced by MeJA treatment or insect attack, along with increased transcript levels detected with the orthologous PaTPS-LAS and PaTPS-Iso probes  29', ' Functional characterization of monoterpene synthases: (-)-ë±/ë_-pinene synthases In contrast to the white spruce enzymes PgTPS-Pin-1 and PgTPS-Pin-2, the newly characterized Sitka spruce PsTPS-Pin enzyme produced a larger proportion of (-)-ë_-pinene (more than 80%) and lesser amounts of (-)-ë±-pinene (less than 13%), but also had four additional minor products not observed with the PgTPS-Pin enzymes (Table  2, Figure  2)', ' These comparisons of product profiles and ratios across a set of orthologous, or likely orthologous, multiproduct (-)-pinene synthases show that overall sequence relatedness is not a good indicator of the specific product profiles and ratios even for closely related TPS enzymes', ' We characterized one new (-)-ë±/ë_-pinene synthase in Sitka spruce (PsTPS-Pin) and two in white spruce (PgTPS-Pin-1 and PgTPS-Pin-2; both originating from the same genotype) (Tables  1 and  2)', ' These three enzymes clustered closely with the two previously characterized (-)-ë±/ë_-pinene synthases from Sitka spruce  32 and Norway spruce  14 in the TPS-d1 clade (Figure  1)', ' The two (-)-ë±/ë_-pinene synthases in white spruce (PgTPS-Pin-1 and PgTPS-Pin-2) contained only four amino acid differences: Q/R94, R/G217, S/N221, and E/G599, but showed an opposing pattern in the relative amounts of ë±- and ë_-pinene produced by the recombinant enzymes (67:33 and 29:71 ë±-pinene:ë_-pinene, respectively, Table  2)', ' One might hypothesize that the E/G599 difference was the origin of the observed product differences between the two white spruce PgTPS-Pin variants', ' Identification of unique TPS sequences and isolation of full-length TPS cDNA clones The  in silico analysis of 443,665 spruce ESTs identified a total of 506 ESTs corresponding to putative TPSs (Table  1)', ' Assembly of these ESTs into contigs and singlets allowed us to estimate the minimum number of actively expressed TPS genes in each of the three spruce species of our analysis', ' We identified 69 unique TPS sequences in white spruce, 55 in Sitka spruce, and 20 in hybrid white spruce', ' Although the rate of gene discovery was dependent on the depth of EST sequencing (Table  1), the substantially deeper EST sequence coverage in white spruce (242,931 ESTs) did not result in a proportional increase of TPS discovery relative to Sitka spruce (174,384 ESTs) and hybrid white spruce (26,350 ESTs), suggesting that the majority of expressed TPSs in the tissues sequenced were captured at the depth of sequencing probed in white spruce and Sitka spruce', ' The estimate of at least 69 TPSs in white spruce is comparable to the number of putatively active TPS genes found in the sequenced genomes of angiosperms and is perhaps a good approximation of the total number of transcriptionally active TPS genes in a conifer species', ' From the set of assembled TPS sequences, we examined approximately 170 of the corresponding cDNA clones by restriction digest, colony PCR and/or sequencing to identify those which contained full ORFs', ' In addition, three full-length TPS cDNA clones were obtained by RACE cloning or homology-based PCR cloning', ' As the Treenomix project  16, which generated the available cDNA clones focused its FLcDNA program on Sitka spruce, the majority of the full-length TPS cDNA clones were from this species (12 FLcDNAs)', ' Five full-length TPS cDNA clones originated from white spruce, and four from hybrid white spruce', ' Functional characterization of monoterpene synthases: (-)-ë_-phellandrene synthases We identified four (-)-ë_-phellandrene synthases in Sitka spruce (PsTPS-Phel-1, PsTPS-Phel-2, PsTPS-Phel-3, and PsTPS-Phel-4), which shared 99% amino acid identity with each other, suggesting that these genes represent nearly identical allelic variants or very recently duplicated genes in the two genotypes that they originated from (Table  3)'",terpene synthase

the chromosomes, as in sorghum, maize, Brachypodium and most dicots', ' In  Zea mays, TPS clusters map both towards center and towards the end of chromosomes', ', a significant number of sequences

newly identified TPS genes was carried out in order to further validate our predictions for the plant kingdom, as well as to improve the resolution of functional role prediction, in terms of molecular function or subcellular localization', ' As described in methods, a total of 2040 TPSs were subjected to ontological analysis and as anticipated, the novel TPSs were found to be enriched in biological process terms like ‰Û÷response to stress‰Ûª, ‰Û÷lipid metabolic pathway‰Ûª and ‰Û÷secondary metabolic process‰Ûª', ' More than 900 TPSs were found to be enriched for primary metabolism, although this class of genes is mostly known for secondary/ specialized metabolism', ' An assessment of these TPSs revealed that they belong to the mono/bifunctional CPS of TPSc and highly divergent TPSe_f gene families', ' Among molecular function categories, highest enrichment was found for terpene synthase activity, catalytic activity and magnesium ion binding activity, as expected, but in few cases, the GO terms were able to resolve the exact catalytic function for a given TPSs, as in case of hydrolases (37 cases), transferases (65 cases) or protein binding activities', ' In eight cases, nucleic acid binding was found to be an enriched term and we looked at these cases in more detail in order to understand how TPSs may bind to DNA/RNA to carry out their function', ' It may be noted that some TPS genes have previously been known to show single-stranded DNA endo-deoxyribonuclease activity or DNA-directed RNA polymerase activity, and take part in double strand break repair via homologues recombination', ' In the sub-cellular compartmentalization category, a majority of mono- and di-TPSs were found to be localized in plastids, as expected, since these are synthesized by the methyl erythritol (MEP) pathway, which is plastidial in nature', ' 134 cases did not follow the expected localization trend, wherein a sesqui-TPS was localized to the plastid and, conversely a mono- or di-TPS was predicted to be localized in the cytoplasm, supporting the notion of crosstalk that has been previously hypothesized between MVA and MEP pathways  7', ' In summary, the GO analysis further supports Terzyme predictions and the huge repertoire of new TPSs thus identified provides an opportunity for further functional characterization', ' Further analyses, as presented in the next section were performed to shed light on the roles and identities of these new TPSs', ' Encouraged by this superior accuracy of prediction, we automated the TPS and PT search pipeline to design and develop the Terzyme interactive online server, available freely without any login requirement at  www', ' It has been configured to accept multiple fasta sequences to search for TPSs, and does not require download on local machines for processing', ' The Terzyme HMM pipeline was used to search for novel TPS and PT gene family members in the entire PSG dataset (containing 1,573,395 protein sequences from 42 plant genomes, as described in Methods), and the resulting identifications have been incorporated into the online web resource for browsing, download and further exploration', ' In all, Terzyme identified a total of 3312 unique TPS sequences and 873 unique prenyl transferases', ' Some of the TPS sequences, as expected, were predicted by both function-based and gene-family based HMMs', ' These 3312 TPSs and 873 PTs are available for browsing, both by species name and taxonomic class, through the ‰Û÷Plant Genome Predictions‰Ûª menu of Terzyme website, as shown in panels B of Fig', ' For each TPS, users can view or download the corresponding sequence in FASTA format, its alignment with the respective sub-family profile HMM, as well as the predicted secondary structure', '  A total of 2040 TPSs were identified by the functional class based profile HMMs and these included 613 monoterpene synthases, 468 diterpene synthases and 959 sesquiterpene synthases', ' Similarly, 2987 TPSs were identified by gene family based profile HMMs which included 1797 TPSa, 432 TPSb, 218 TPSc, 81 TPSd, 270 TPSe_f and 189 TPSg gene family sequences', ' Interestingly, our data shows identification of putative TPSs in three chlorophyte genomes even though none of the profile HMMs were trained on these species', ' A manual inspection of each sequence shows them to have sufficient length and presence of the requisite TPS motifs', ' From a functional point of view, all chlorophyte TPSs appear to be Diterpene synthases, the ancient TPS containing family, known previously to consist of both gymnosperm and angiosperm members', ' A detailed analysis of some of these DiTPSs indicated them to be closely related to Cycloartenol synthase and some were found to contain Squalene cyclase (SQCY) found in class II TPSs', ' Among bryophytes,  Physcomitrella patens shows\xa0only one known bifunctional TPSs with both CPS/KS activity has been reported till date  24', ' The present analysis reveals the additional presence of at least nine bifunctional TPSs, and we have identified 15 prenyl transferases in the moss genome, suggesting a reasonably large terpenome family with more than 30 members, majority of these being previously unreported diterpene synthases', ' The gene family profiles assign most of these sequences to the TPSa and TPSc subfamilies', ' As anticipated, 64 of the 72 putative TPSs identified in the gymnosperm genome ( Picea abies) were assigned to TPSd subfamily, supporting the existing view that gymnosperm TPSs belong to a distinct clade  19', ' Tables\xa0 5 and  6 also depict five gymnosperm TPS sequences representing the most ancient TPSc gene family, with mono/bifunctional CPSs, although we did not observe any bias of representation in case of functional class assignment; all three classes namely monoTPS, diTPS and sesqui-TPS are roughly equally present in this gymnosperm', ' Under the Plant Genome Predictions Tab, apart from the Diterpene TPS classification, for each genome, Terzyme shows the exact number of matches found for TPSc and TPSe_f classes, both of which represent largely, the CPS and KSL respectively', ' We believe this is a very useful feature that enables users to breakdown Di-TPS data for detecting better-resolved functional annotations', ' It may also be noted that the identified TPS gene family size increases from lower plants (chlorophytes, bryophytes and pteridophytes) to land plants, suggesting expansion of the family during course of evolution', ' An average of 30‰ÛÒ50 TPS sequences were identified across higher plants, with the maximum number of sequences detected in  Panicum virgatum (switchgrass), along with commercial fruit bearing dicot species like apple, grape and papaya', ' The Eucalyptus genome also contains over one hundred TPS sequences and it would be interesting to study these TPSs further and characterize their roles in the respective genomes', ' Present knowledge of completely characterized TPSs is limited to only few plant species and their classification based on functional roles or gene family is still an emerging field', ' Our data on the other hand opens up a huge repertoire of putative TPSs candidates throughout the plant kingdom, together with their functional, and gene family based classification', ' For example, the tomato terpenome was recently characterized with about 40 TPS  15, whereas our analysis reveals at least 60‰ÛÒ100 TPSs in the  S', ' In addition, Diterpene TPS classification has been performed based on class I (Aspartate rich motif (DDXXD/E) or\xa0Non-aspartate rich consensus motif of ( N, D)D(L,I,V)X( S, T)XXX E also called as ‰Û÷NSE/DTE‰Ûª motif and class II (DXDD) signature motifs present in the respective sequences', ' In house perl script were used to scan all the DiTPS annotations to assess the presence of these signature motifs for Class I and Class II TPSs', ' Accordingly, TERZYME classifies DiTPSs into the

sesqui-TPSs) as well as the sequence homology based gene-family classes, namely TPSa to TPSg  19', ' As can be seen in Table\xa0 2, this dataset contains 113 TPSa, 49 TPSb, 35 TPSc, 48 TPSd, 50 TPSe_f and 31 TPSg sequences, mainly present in seed plants', ' No TPS has been annotated to date in chlorophytes', ' Lower plants like ferns and mosses also have very few PTs or TPSs', ' Similarly, genomes of ancient land plants like the magnoliales also appear to lack PTs or TPSs as per their current annotations', ' As expected, only gymnosperm sequences are present in the TPSd subfamily, known to be specific to this clade', '  Profile hidden Markov models and predictive accuracy Profile HMMs were built for the prenyl transferase family and all 12 classes of TPS subfamilies, as described in methods', ' For TPSs, analysis was divided into two parts, function based analysis and gene family based analysis', ' In gene family based (GB) analysis, the test sequence is assigned to one of the six gene families described earlier from TPSa to g, with HMMs being generated from the GB dataset', ' acquisition of TPS sequences from other sub-families', ' The high rate of false positives severely affects sub-family annotation towards prediction of substrate specificity and may be ascribed to the strong homology between various TPS sub-classes, both at sequence and structural levels', ' The various TPS sub-family representatives used for structural superimposition included the 1,8-cineole synthase from  Salvia fruticosa for Monoterpene synthases (PDBID 25JC), the Taxadiene synthase from Pacific yew for Di-TPSs (PDB ID 3P5P) and the 5-epi aristolochene synthase from  Nicotiana tabacum (PDBID 3M00) representing sesqui-TPSs', ' As a result, correct annotation and classification of newly identified TPSs becomes a significant challenge in view of conservation between the different TPS superfamilies', ' As can be seen from Table\xa0 4, the final accuracy of the search algorithm increases to 100% for a majority of sub-families, with the exception of dicot-specific profiles for Mono- and Sesqui-TPSs, both of which show accuracy above 85%', ' However, we found that none of the currently existing programs could classify TPSs either based on their function i', ' into monoterpene, diterpene or sesquiterpene synthases, nor on the basis of gene family (TPSa-TPSe/f)', ' The Terzyme hidden markov models, in contrast, achieve taxon-based distinction between identified TPSs', ' One reason for the failure of general annotation databases may be that available programs like Pfam identify TPSs by detecting either the N-terminal domain naming them as Terpene_synth (PF01397) or the metal binding domain designating it as Terpene_synth_C (PF03936) or both', ' Hence, from a predictive viewpoint, it can be inferred that our search algorithm performs better than existing programs for TPS gene family identification in the plant kingdom'",terpene synthase
